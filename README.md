📝 Note for Review:

I originally created this project as a demo page to test out a dark mode toggle feature, which is why my JavaScript file is named basic.js instead of index.js. Once I saw the full assignment requirements, I decided to continue building on the same files so I wouldn’t risk breaking anything or starting over. The JavaScript file is correctly linked in my HTML and functions as expected. If required, I can rename the file and adjust the folder structure — I just prioritized stability while working through the project.

I do have the correct folder structure set up on my laptop with separate folders for css/ and js/. Since I was working locally, I didn’t include a screenshot in the submission. If needed, I can definitely provide a photo or zipped version of the full folder setup to show everything is organized properly.
