# 🌤️ API Project – Weather Dashboard + Portfolio

## 💡 About the Project

This project combines a **portfolio-style homepage** with an **Open-Meteo weather data fetcher** to meet the Open API Project requirements. It demonstrates:

* Dynamic data fetching using JavaScript
* DOM manipulation
* Responsive layout with **dark mode**
* Integration of **two endpoints** from the Open-Meteo API

## 📄 Features

* 🌐 Displays current weather using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)
* 🎨 Toggleable **dark/light mode** (original reason this demo was created!)
* 🛠️ Modular JavaScript in `basic.js`
* ⛅ Weather icons based on conditions (`weather_code`)
* 📬 "Leave a Message" form (JS dynamic injection)
* 💼 GitHub API fetch showing most recent projects
* 🦶 Dynamically updated footer (current year)
* 🌟 Responsive layout, accessible styling

## 🔧 File Structure (Locally)

While the uploaded version contains all files in one folder for simplicity, the local version is organized like this:

```
/project-root
│
├── index.html
├── /css
│   └── style.css
├── /js
│   └── basic.js
```

> I can provide a ZIP or photo of the organized folder if needed!

## 📝 Note for Review

I originally created this project as a demo page to test out a dark mode toggle feature, which is why my JavaScript file is named basic.js instead of index.js. Once I saw the full assignment requirements, I decided to continue building on the same files so I wouldn’t risk breaking anything or starting over. The JavaScript file is correctly linked in my HTML and functions as expected. If required, I can rename the file and adjust the folder structure — I just prioritized stability while working through the project.

I do have the correct folder structure set up on my laptop with separate folders for css/ and js/. Since I was working locally, I didn’t include a screenshot in the submission. If needed, I can definitely provide a photo or zipped version of the full folder setup to show everything is organized properly.
